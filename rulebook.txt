## Gifts Under Siege — Quick Rules (English)

A fast interactive card game using **Magic: The Gathering basic lands** as resources. Steal gifts, lock them down, and race to the most points.

---

# 1) Goal

Collect gifts worth the most points by the end of the game.

**Scoring**

* Class I gift = **1 point**
* Class II gift = **2 points**
* Class III gift = **3 points**

---

# 2) Components

* A shared deck of **basic land cards** (any colors mixed).
* Physical **gift items** (or gift cards), each labeled with:

  * a **color** (W/U/B/R/G)
  * a **class** (I / II / III)
* **Lock tokens** (dice/coins) to track how protected a gift is.
* 4 **Building** cards (any MTG cards with these building rules written on them).

---

# 3) Setup

1. Reveal **8 gifts** face-up in the center (for 7–8 players).
2. Shuffle all basic lands into one **shared deck**.
3. Each player draws **5 lands** as their opening hand.
4. Each player starts with **0 lands in play** and **no buildings**.

---

# 4) Gift Costs (Class + Color Requirement)

To **claim** or **steal** a gift, you must pay its **mana cost** using lands **in play**, and you must meet the **color requirement**.

* **Class I:** pay **3 mana total**, including **at least 2** mana of the gift’s color
* **Class II:** pay **5 mana total**, including **at least 3** mana of the gift’s color
* **Class III:** pay **7 mana total**, including **at least 4** mana of the gift’s color

**Mana comes only from lands you have played** (tapped as in Magic).

**Land limit:** you may have at most **10 lands in play**.

---

# 5) Locks and Ownership

Each gift has **0–5 Locks**.

* When you **claim** a gift, it enters your area with **1 Lock**.
* A gift with **5 Locks** is **Sealed** and **cannot be stolen**.

---

# 6) Paying Locks When Stealing (Hand matters!)

When you steal a gift with **L Locks**, you must also pay a “lock cost” by **discarding L land cards from your hand**.

* Each discarded land counts as **1** (color does not matter for lock payment).

---

# 7) Turn Structure

On your turn, do the following in order:

### 1) Draw

Draw **1 land** from the shared deck.

### 2) Play a Land

You may play **1 land** from your hand (if you have fewer than 10 lands in play).

### 3) Take ONE Main Action

Choose exactly **one**:

**A) Claim a Gift**
Pay its mana + color requirement. Take it. Add **1 Lock** to it.

**B) Steal a Gift** 😈
Choose an opponent’s gift that is not Sealed (Locks < 5).
Pay its mana + color requirement, then discard lands from hand equal to its current Locks. Take it.
*(Stealing does not add locks by default.)*

**C) Wrap (Add Locks)**
Choose one of your gifts. Discard **1 land from your board** → add **+1 Lock** (max 5).

**D) Build a Building**
Pay the building cost and place it in your area.
You may have **at most 2 Buildings**. You can substitute existing buildings with new ones.

**E) Recycle**
Draw **1 additional land**. Then discard **1 land** from your hand.

### 4) Hand Limit

At end of your turn, if you have more than **7** cards in hand, discard down to **7**.

---

# 8) Buildings (4)

Recommended building cost: **4 mana total**, including **at least 2** mana of the building’s color.

You may have **only 2 building**.

**1) Thief’s Gloves (Black)**
When you steal, reduce the lock discard by up to **2**:
you discard **max(0, Locks − 2)** instead of Locks.

**2) Crowbar (Red)**
After you successfully steal a gift, you may add **+1 Lock** to that stolen gift (max 5).

**3) Reinforced Ribbon (Green)**
When you use Wrap, you add **+2 Locks** instead of +1 (max 5).

**4) Supply Warehouse (Blue)**
When you choose the Recycle action, draw **2** lands instead of 1. Then discard **1** land from your hand.

**5) Inviolable Coffer (White)**
When you claim a gift, it enters your board with **2 Locks** instead of 1.

---

# 9) Ending the Game

Play until either:

* A timer ends (**25–30 minutes** recommended), or
* You run out of available gifts to refill the display.

Then everyone totals points from their gifts. Highest score wins.
